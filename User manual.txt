MATLAB function for the evaluation of displacements in a half-space due to 
vertical load on a polygonal domain of the half-space surface.

Syntax:
U=LoPro(xyz,r,p,E,v)

Description:
U=LoPro(xyz,r,p,E,v) returns the three components of displacement at the
point of coordinate xyz=[x;y;z] of the half-space z>0, with Young modulus
E and Poisson ration v, generated by a vertical load p uniformly applied 
on the polygonal region of vertices r of the surface of the half-space.
r=[x1,y1;x2,y2;...] is an array containing in each row the two coordinates 
of the vertices of the polygon which describes the loaded region.

Example: see TestLoPro.m
This example script allows for a comparison with the results for a 
rectangular loaded region already analyzed in:
